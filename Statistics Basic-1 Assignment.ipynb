    "- According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, statistics is defined as “classified facts representing the conditions of a people in a state – especially the facts that can be stated in numbers or any other tabular or classified arrangement”.\n",

    "# Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "- In this type of statistics, the data is summarised through the given observations. The summarisation is one from a sample of population using parameters such as the mean or standard deviation.\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics is a way to organise, represent and describe a collection of data using tables, graphs, and summary measures. For example, the collection of people in a city using the internet or using Television.\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics are also categorised into four different categories:\n",
    "- Measure of frequency\n",
    "- Measure of dispersion\n",
    "- Measure of central tendency\n",
    "- Measure of position\n",
    "- The frequency measurement displays the number of times a particular data occurs. Range, Variance, Standard Deviation are measures of dispersion. It identifies the spread of data. Central tendencies are the mean, median and mode of the data. And the measure of position describes the percentile and quartile ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inferential Statistics\n",
    "- This type of statistics is used to interpret the meaning of Descriptive statistics. That means once the data has been collected, analysed and summarised then we use these stats to describe the meaning of the collected data. Or we can say, it is used to draw conclusions from the data that depends on random variations such as observational errors, sampling variation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inferential Statistics is a method that allows us to use information collected from a sample to make decisions, predictions or inferences from a population. It grants us permission to give statements that goes beyond the available data or information. For example, deriving estimates from hypothetical research."
